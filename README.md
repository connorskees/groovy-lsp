# groovy-lsp

An implementation of the Microsoft Language Server Protocol for Groovy

### Motivation

Largely, I would like the bare minimum of support for Groovy in Visual Studio Code.
To this end, this project in its early stages seeks to implement only a subset of
the language and the Language Server Protocol. I currently edit Groovy with minimal
syntax highlighting, no error reporting, and no completion. The philosophy of this project
is such that even a slight improvement upon that is a success.
